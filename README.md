# mvc-cake-pattern

This repo aims to experiment with some advanced concepts of Functional Programming and Scala3:
- Component programming with `Cake Pattern` 
- `Monadic` representation of computation (with [Monix Task](https://monix.io/docs/current/eval/task.html))
- `Monadic` description of the view (wrapping Swing components into Monix tasks)
